This project measures the rate of ice melting. For example, if the temperature and humidity are at certain levels, how long will it take for the ice to melt? 
  
To conduct experiments, we will place the ice on various surfaces such as iron, ground, plastic, tile and wood.

## Features:
- `Overview`: The main page of the project see weather forecast, visualized data and the statistical data of the ice melting.
- `Tables`: The table view of the ice melting data.
  - **Ice Experiment**: The ice melting data.
  - **Material**: The material data.
  - **Weather Condition**: The weather condition data.
- `API Query`: The documentation of the API.
